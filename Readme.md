# Minimal React App Boilerplate

## Features
- jsx support
- webpack dev server
- hotloading
- routing with react router
- babel support
- prop type checking
- eslint (using airbnb's config)
- Easy to use scripts for production builds

## Using the boilerplate
1. Clone the repo
2. from the root, run npm start. This runs the dev server


## Commands
- `npm start`: starts the dev server
- `npm run lintproject`: lints the entire repo
- `npm run lint -- ${filepath}`: lints the file you specify (npm run lint is basically a macro for eslint so you can pass in whatever args you want)
- `npm run build`: creates a production build of your web app. All files needed for deployment are in the dist folder
